# Indemnity Form Website

This repository contains a simple, legally sound indemnity form designed for events or outings. The form ensures that participants willingly engage in the activity and waive all claims against the provider in case of losses, damages, or injuries. This form collects the necessary details from participants, including an emergency contact option. 

## Features

- **Participant Information Collection**: The form captures full name, South African ID number, phone number, and email address of the participant.
- **Emergency Contact Option**: Participants have the option to provide emergency contact details.
- **Indemnity and Waiver**: The form includes legally sound terms and conditions that participants agree to, waiving claims for any potential injuries, damages, or losses incurred during the event.
- **Email Submission**: When participants submit the form, the data is sent to an organiser's email using Formspree, and a confirmation email can be sent to the participant (depending on your Formspree setup).
  
## How It Works

1. The participant fills out the form, providing their personal details and agreeing to the indemnity terms.
2. They submit the form, and their information is sent to the organiser via email.
3. The form also includes an optional emergency contact section that can be toggled on or off.
4. All terms and conditions of participation are clearly listed, and the form submission acts as an agreement to those terms.
